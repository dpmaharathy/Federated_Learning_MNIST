# Federated_Learning_MNIST
Federated Learning Implementation with PyTorch

##Developed a federated learning framework utilizing PyTorch to perform digit classification on three distinct datasets: MNIST, Coloured MNIST, and SVHN. Implemented a client-server architecture where individual models were trained on 10,000 samples (1,000 per class) for each client dataset, with 5,000 samples reserved for testing.

##Key accomplishments included:

###Successfully aggregated model updates at a central server to enhance classification accuracy.
###Reported class-wise accuracy results for each client dataset and the aggregated central model, along with overall classification accuracy and confusion matrices.
###Conducted a mathematical analysis of the aggregation function used at the server.
###Provided a detailed explanation of the federated learning algorithm, including diagrammatic representations.
###Compared the overall accuracy of the federated setup against a baseline non-federated setup, analyzing the implications of the results.
###This project reinforced my understanding of federated learning principles and enhanced my skills in distributed machine learning, model aggregation, and performance evaluation.
